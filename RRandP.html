                    <h1 style="font-size:125%;">What is a Router?</h1>   
          <p>- A router connects different networks in order to create a path to transmit packets. <br>- Packets must go through routers to get to their destination.<br> - Packets can go through many different routers before reaching their final destination</p>

                 <h2 style="font-size:125%;">What is Redundancy?</h2> 
                    <p> - Redundancy ensures that the connections are fully functioning and are uninterupted </p>
<h3 style="font-size:125%;">What problem does redundancy solve?</h3>    <p>Redundancy is plays a significant role in functionality. Within the network there are many paths between different routers so that if something were to disrupt one path such as "a racoon eating a path" the connection would still be able to function</p>                 <img src="redun.jpeg" width=45% height=45%>     
                    <h4 style="font-size:125%;">What is a Packet?</h4> 
                    <p>- A packet contains a message that travels through networks/routers</p>
                    <h5 style="font-size:125%;">What problem do packets solve?</h5>  <p> - Packets contain smaller chunks of messages. This is because when sending a message, especially a larger file, an error during transmission could disrupt the entire message and cut it. <br><br> - Packets were designed to prevent these types of error by splitting the message into smaller pieces <br><br> - Once the reciever recieves all the packets they can reorder them to form the message even if the packets arrived in the wrong order.</p>
